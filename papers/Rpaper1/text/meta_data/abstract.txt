Scientific theories explain phenomena using simplifying assumptions: for instance, that the speed of light does not depend on the direction in which the light is moving, or that the height of a pea plant depends on a small number of alleles randomly obtained from its parents. The ability to support these simplifying assumptions with statistical evidence is crucial to scientific progress, though it might involve "accepting" the null hypothesis. We review two historical examples where statistical evidence was used to accept a simplifying assumption (rejecting the luminiferous aether and genetic theory) and one where the null hypothesis was not accepted in spite of repeated failures (gravitational waves), drawing lessons from each. We emphasize the role of the scientific context in the acceptance of the null: accepting the null is never a purely statistical affair.
