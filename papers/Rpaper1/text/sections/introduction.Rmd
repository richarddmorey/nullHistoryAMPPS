On a warm summer morning in 1887, Albert Michelson hunched over a heavy stone table in a basement of Western Reserve College. He peered through an eyepiece whose other end disappeared under a wooden hood covering the table. With his right hand, he slowly turned a screw to calibrate one of sixteen mirrors fixed to the stone. Beneath the hood, beams of yellow sodium light bounced back and forth between the mirrors along two perpendicular paths that both ended at the eyepiece. By adjusting the screw, Michelson ensured that the lengths of the two paths were equal. 

The stone slab sat on a piece of wood which itself was floating in a pool of liquid mercury. Around noon Michelson gave the table a push, causing it to slowly spin.  Every 22.5 degrees of rotation --- about as many seconds --- he looked through the eyepiece and scribbled down a number. That afternoon he took over one-hundred readings, stopping only to give the table a small push to keep it spinning. He came back that evening for another hundred measurements, repeating the process again over the next two days.

The numbers Michelson and his colleague Edward Morley scribbled down in 1887 would eventually be among the most celebrated results in science. What they found --- or rather, what they didn't find --- was a quandary for popular nineteenth century theories of light propagation. Michelson and Morley's [-@Michelson:Morley:1887] result foreshadowed not one but *two* revolutions in physics --- special relativity and quantum theory --- and eventually won Michelson the Nobel prize in physics. 

It has been noted for decades that psychological science largely rests on the assertion of statistical differences using null hypothesis significance tests rather than resting on understanding sameness, patterns, or regularity [see e.g. @Gigerenzer:etal:2004; @Meehl:1978; @Sterling:etal:1995]. We present three historical vignettes involving null inferences (or lack thereof) in mature sciences. None of these inferences rest on significant differences from null hypothesis significance tests, but they are nevertheless examples of scientific progress. The first is Michelson and Morley's null result; the second, Mendel's famous (and controversial) genetic experiments [@Mendel:1866; @Fisher:1936]; and the third, the recent Nobel-prize-winning findings by the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) team. Understanding how the scientific context supports null inferences is key to understanding why statistical nulls have traditionally been ignored in psychology.
