In these three examples, a type of statistical null was rejected or accepted in relation to pragmatic considerations of what would facilitate the accumulation of scientific knowledge. Michelson and Morley's result, for instance, appeared more compelling because an alternative to wave theory could account for the result. On the other hand, there is no alternative to general relativity, so the lack of gravitational waves would throw physics into crisis. Fisher noted that Mendel could have derived his predictions from three simpler theoretical postulates, rather than from the data themselves. In all three cases, the evidential value of the data was considered along with higher-level theoretical concerns within a theoretical paradigm. The experiments were not meant to show an isolated effect; rather, they were tests or demonstrations of aspects of a broad theory.

In contrast, paradigmatic research programs --- with concordant null hypotheses --- have become scarce in the contemporary field of psychology. The paradigmatic progress exemplified by these three examples would not be possible within psychology's current research landscape, which closely aligns with the Kuhnian description of a Pre-paradigm Science. This was not always true; in the mid twentieth century, psychological theorising had coalesced into several broad paradigmatic perspectives [e.g., Cognitive Dissonance Theory, @Festinger:1957]. However, the subsequent decades saw psychology transform back into a discipline more clearly characterized by a pre-paradigm population of micro-theories. Often, these micro-theories consist solely of the described effect, followed by the word "theory" or "model", resulting in empty restatements. Insofar as they can be construed as unfalsifiable, one might call them pseudo-theories [@Fiedler:2004]. To the extent that these descriptive theories are arrived at entirely post-hoc, they can constitute entire pseudoscience disciplines (Lakatos, 1970).

Consider the facial feedback hypothesis [@Strack:etal:1988], in which feedback from the face is assumed to modulate emotion. @Wagenmakers:etal:2016b recently attempted to replicate the 1988 study, obtaining a null result across several labs and thousands of participants. In Normal Science, this might lead to a paradigmatic crisis or new boundary conditions, either of which could be construed as progress. Instead, @Wagenmakers:etal:2016b simply claim a failure to replicate, leaving @Strack:2016 to offer a series of *post hoc* reasons why it might not have replicated. It is not clear what was learned from the episode, because the facial feedback hypothesis is not strongly linked to a broader paradigm positing boundary conditions and mechanisms; it is a label for an effect. When an effect stands on its own, rather than in relation to a paradigm, the implications a null result has for the progress of psychological science are unclear.[^9] 


[^9]: This is not to say that null results are not important outside of Normal Science; it is just to say that their interpretation depends on having a paradigmatic background against which to understand them. Science is more than a catalog observations, but such a catalog may be a crucial ingredient to a developing scientific paradigm.

On the surface, psychology espouses the same standards of hypothesis testing as most mature sciences: a Popperian (1959) emphasis on falsificationism predicated hypotheses derived from explanatory paradigms. These typically constitute clear predictions that distinguish the underlying explanatory accounts of distinct paradigms, allowing for the specification and testing of theoretical boundary conditions which illuminate the cases in which a particular paradigm may be more or less explanatory compared to its rivals [@McGuire:2013].  Within the context of psychology, theoretical boundary conditions necessarily take on a different character, given that "theories" are often little more than descriptions of phenomena, with "boundaries" that cannot extend beyond descriptions of individual effects.

When falsification can no longer be tethered to the boundary conditions of explanatory paradigms, Popperian null hypothesis testing shifts to the reliability of individual effects; if an effect does not replicate as predicted, it has been "falsified" [@Ferguson:Heene:2012]. Accordingly, the historical emphasis on theory-framed hypothesis testing has been replaced by the statistical significance of hypothesized effects [e.g., @Benjamin:etal:2018; @OpenScienceCollaboration:2012; @OpenScienceCollaboration:2015; @Simmons:etal:2011] where these predictions are increasingly tested against a pre-registered hypothesis for predicted outcomes. In a Normal Science setting, experimental hypotheses follow from predictions that themselves follow from well-developed theories, obviating the need for the pre-registration of the hypothesis. Moreover, replacing paradigmatic falsifiability with replicability of *effects* discourages researchers from attending to the paradigmatic principles that allow for contextualized assessments of the evidential value of a given of replication "failure" [@Stroebe:Strack:2014]. This further entrenches, rather than opposes, the pre-paradigm nature of much of psychological science [also see @Fiedler:etal:2012].

Acting within Normal Science, all three groups of experimenters we have highlighted --- Michelson and Morley, Mendel, and the LIGO team --- are celebrated for their careful experimentation. Michelson invented multiple iterations of his device to reduce the noise in his measurements. Mendel grew thousands of pea plants across 84 experiments to demonstrate his theory. The LIGO team invested a decade honing their experimental skills before finding a single gravitational wave. This attention to detail is possible when scientific progress is not defined by arguments over individual effects and statistical significance, but is rather guided by work within, or opposing, a broad paradigm. If psychology reasserts itself as a Normal Science, only then will it become a field unified by wide-ranging theoretical perspectives in which evidence for statistical regularities are valued at least as much as significant differences.
